      <h2>Muhammad Ali The Greatest Boxer</h2>

        <b>Muhammad Ali The Greatest</b>, (born January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.died in June
        3,2016,Scottsdale,Arizona U.S).hebegantraining as an amateur boxer at age 12.he was American professional boxer
        and
        social activist.Ali was thefirst fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on three separate
        occasions,he successfully defended this title 19 times.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">

        Ali was not the tallest boxer, nor was he as bulky as most other boxers of his time, his punches were not the
        strongest, but he was still the best fighter of his time. His agility was impressive, but what was most
        impressive was his confidence in himself.he took up boxing under the tutelage of Louisville policeman Joe
        Martin.After advancing through the amateur ranks, he won a gold medal in the 175-pound division at the
        1960.Muhammad Ali was more highly regarded for his charm and personality than for his ring skills.He sought to
        raise public interest in his fights by reading childlike poetry and spouting self-descriptive phrases such as
        “float like a butterfly,sting like a bee.” He told the world that he was “the Greatest,” but the hard realities
        of boxing seemed to indicate otherwise.Ali infuriated devotees of the sport as much as he impressed them.

      </p>
      <p class="p3">

        Ali says, “It's the repetition of affirmations that leads to belief.And once that belief becomes a deep
        conviction, things begin to happen.”He believed without a doubt that he was the best fighter of all time,and he
        even pushed this belief upon his opponents.He kept repeating to himself and anybody that would listen that he
        was the greatest of all time.
        This mentality allowed to take the punches and keep moving forward.In his earlier fights, his opponents were
        heavily favored, but he still managed to pull off the impossible.The power of his mind can be demonstrated in
        how he was able to beat the undefeated George Foreman in one of the biggest upsets in the history of boxing.He
        had previously lost against Ken Norton and Joe Frazier, and many thought that his career was coming to an end,
        but Ali knew that this was not the case. He believed he was destined to be the greatest boxer of all time.Ali
        trained even harder, and most importantly he created a mentality that would allow him to face any challenge.
      </p>
      <p class="p4">
        During the fight, he took all the punches that Foreman threw at him.The match dragged to the 8th round where a
        tired Foreman fell to the ground and was not able to get back up on time.Muhammad Ali was then crowned world
        heavyweight champion for the third and final time.Looking back, Foreman said “I'll admit it.Muhammad outthought
        me and outfought me.In his excellent autobiography, the champ reveals a good deal about himself.He goes into
        detail about the strategy he devised to totally “psych out” champion Sonny Liston before their first fight.This
        book does a great job of going inside Ali's mind.Reading the book feels like sitting with Ali alone and hearing
        him answer all the questions you ever wanted to ask him.

      </p>
      <p class="p5">
        This example of perseverance in the face of impossible odds is a beautiful analogy to what happens in our
        lives.The way we perceive things is crucial. Life is often a mirror that reflects what we are and what we
        believe.The more we believe that we can do something the more we can push to achieve our goals. There are
        difficult and painful moments in everything we undertake, but if we remain relentless, our challenges become
        more acceptable.Leading us to push our limits and eventually reach our wildest dreams.
